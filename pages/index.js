            Charlotte Coding Club will be for 5th-12th graders, and will start
            March 1, 3:30-4:30pm, and run every Tuesday for 6 weeks. In class
            weâ€™ll be building websites, games and art using many popular coding
            languages such as HTML, CSS, Javascript, Python and more. Kids will
            get to know their way around the hardware. We may start off by
            hacking Minecraft, designing Instagram filters, or just making some
            silly websites. Beginners are welcome. Advanced coders who want to
            move into Rust, Python, C++, and other trickier projects should
            definitely join.{" "}

            Jessica (on the right) is a professional software engineer and
            Christina (on the left) is new to coding. We both live in Charlotte.
            Drop by and try out one club meeting. Coding is a wonderful skill
            that leads to the high-paying jobs that will help build our future
            economy, Coding also teaches problem solving, cooperation and
            critical thinking. Coding is a lot of fun, and something everyone
            can learn to do.

                Hack Club gives you a worldwide community of thousands of other
                young makers to talk to. Weâ€™re artists, writers, engineers,
                tinkerers, campers, filmmakers, volunteers. We make things. We
                help one another. We have fun. Join us.

              <h1 className="dark:text-black">Learn as you build</h1>
              <p>
                Just as the best carpenters didnâ€™t learn in the classroom,
                neither did the best programmers. Through our workshops, youâ€™ll
                be walked through building projects. Starting out, you wonâ€™t
                understand how the code works, but youâ€™ll build understanding as
                you go. Youâ€™ll get stuck along the way, but weâ€™re here to help.
              </p>

              <h1 className="dark:text-black">Start build</h1>
              <p>
                Most coding classes teach you programming concepts instead of
                how to write real codeâ€”itâ€™s like trying to learn carpentry
                without any wood. So at Hack Club, you learn to code entirely
                through building things. You start with no experience and build
                and ship a project every meeting.

              <h1 className="dark:text-black">Coding is the future</h1>
              <p>
                Learning to code is uniquely like gaining a superpower: it
                converts you from a consumer to a creator. Suddenly, computers
                become a tool for creating.
