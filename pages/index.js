            Charlotte Coding Club is for 5th-12th graders that runs every Tuesday for 6 weeks. In the club,
            we'll be building websites, games and art using many popular coding
            languages such as HTML, CSS, Javascript, Python and more. Kids will
            get to know their way around the hardware. Beginners are welcome.
            Advanced coders should definitely join as we can work in Ruby, Rails,
            JavaScript and React, plus Unity and C# (for game dev).

            Christina is new to coding and Jessica is a professional software engineer.
            We both live in Charlotte. Drop by and try out one club meeting.
            Coding is a wonderful skill that leads to the high-paying jobs that
            will help build our future economy. Coding also teaches problem solving,
            cooperation and critical thinking. Coding is a lot of fun, and something
            everyone can learn to do!

              <p>
                Hack Club gives you a worldwide community of thousands of other
                young makers to talk to. Weâ€™re artists, writers, engineers,
                tinkerers, campers, filmmakers, volunteers. We make things. We
                help one another. We have fun. Join us.

              <h1 className="font-3xl font-bold">Learn as you build</h1>
              <p>
                Just as the best carpenters didnâ€™t learn in the classroom,
                neither did the best programmers. Through our workshops, youâ€™ll
                be walked through building projects. Starting out, you wonâ€™t
                understand how the code works, but youâ€™ll build understanding as
                you go. Youâ€™ll get stuck along the way, but weâ€™re here to help.

              <h1 className="font-3xl font-bold">Start building</h1>
              <p>
                Most coding classes teach you programming concepts instead of
                how to write real codeâ€”itâ€™s like trying to learn carpentry
                without any wood. So at Hack Club, you learn to code entirely
                through building things. You start with no experience and build
                and ship a project every meeting.

              <p>
                Learning to code is uniquely like gaining a superpower: it
                converts you from a consumer to a creator. Suddenly, computers
                become a tool for creating.
