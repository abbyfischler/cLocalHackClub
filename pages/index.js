                  <p>Hack Club gives you a worldwide community of thousands of other young makers to talk to. Weâ€™re artists, writers, engineers, tinkerers, campers, filmmakers, volunteers. We make things. We help one another. We have fun. Join us.</p>

                  <p>Just as the best carpenters didnâ€™t learn in the classroom, neither did the best programmers. Through our workshops, youâ€™ll be walked through building projects. Starting out, you wonâ€™t understand how the code works, but youâ€™ll build understanding as you go. Youâ€™ll get stuck along the way, but weâ€™re here to help.</p>

                  <p>Most coding classes teach you programming concepts instead of how to write real codeâ€”itâ€™s like trying to learn carpentry without any wood. So at Hack Club, you learn to code entirely through building things. You start with no experience and build and ship a project every meeting.</p>

                  <h1 className="dark:text-black">Coding is the future</h1>
                  <p>Learning to code is uniquely like gaining a superpower: it converts you from a consumer to a creator. Suddenly, computers become a tool for creating.</p>
